# RoadDirections

Given a graph of roads (or anything for that matter) and two intersections (nodes), this program returns a comprehensive list of driving directions from point A to point B using depth first search. The program can also use union find to return whether or not a graph (system of roads) is fully connected. The following example graph represents the road network around Northeastern University.

Below is an example query: As you can see, the program calculates and returns the shortest path from the intersection of St Stephen and Gainsborough to the intersection of Forsyth Way and Hemenway.
